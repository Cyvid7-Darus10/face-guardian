# Enhancing Security in Facial Recognition Authentication via OAuth Protocol for Third-Party Accessibility

This is a Github repository for a novel approach to authentication that combines facial recognition technology with the OAuth protocol. The system aims to provide a user-friendly and secure authentication method that is easy to integrate with various websites.

The system is designed to prevent the creation of fake accounts by utilizing the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm for facial recognition and the dlib library for facial detection and landmark estimation. The integration of OAuth enables third-party accessibility, allowing for easy integration and use of the facial recognition system across various platforms and services.

To ensure compatibility with third-party platforms, the OAuth 2.0 open standard for authorization will be integrated into the system. The system also provides a secure token-based user authentication mechanism, increasing security.

This repository will include the source code for the facial recognition and OAuth-based authentication system, as well as documentation on how to integrate it into other websites. The system will be thoroughly evaluated through usability testing, security assessment, performance evaluation, and OAuth protocol compatibility testing to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an account on the website using the facial recognition and OAuth-based authentication system
2. Log in to your account using the same authentication method
3. Use the website's services and features as usual
4. Go to the sample site that uses the Face Guardian OAuth system
